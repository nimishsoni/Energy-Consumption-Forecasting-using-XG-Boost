Contains python code to analyze and forecast Energy Consumption using Kaggle dataset of PJM East Operator

## Installations and Quick Start
Install Python Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Maptplotlib, Seaborn, Xgboost, sklearn
Clone the repo https://github.com/nimishsoni/Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-using-XG-Boost.git

## Project Motivation
This work is part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project requirement. Since my expertise is in Energy field and work on similar dataset professionally, I chose Kaggle dataset on Hourly energy consumption of an Electricity transfmission operator in US. https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption.
